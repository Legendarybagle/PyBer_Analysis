# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this secondary analysis was to see the differences or similarities in Fares depending on city type. The data was sorted by city type and various calculatios were done to determine how the fares were affected.
  
## Results

  The results of the analysis clearly showed that the Urban cities had much higher total fares. This makes sense given the fact that urban areas often have high population and lots of things to do and places to be. It could be interesting to see how the cities public transportation affects these results city to city, as places with good train/bus systems likely require less rides. Suburban had the next highest and rural was the lowest in total fares, which again is likely to do with lower population and less things to do. Also people living in rural/suburban areas are more likely to require a car to go to most places and therefore are more likely to own a car VS in a big city where you can walk/bus a lot and then just use a ride sharing app occasionally.
  
 ## Recommendations
  * Focus more on advertising in rural and suburban areas to make poeple think of PyBer as an option more of the time.
  * Try to get more people to sign up as drivers in Urban areas by saying that they are in the best area to make good money.
  * Lower fares in certain areas or at certain times to make it more enticing to people to take Pyber in those cases
